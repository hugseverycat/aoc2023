"""
This code is trash

Basically I suck at detecting cycles and I gave up, so I just let it ran and watched the output
And then when I thought I had a cycle I did math to calculate the 1,000,000,000th cycle
It turned out that my input started a loop on 198 and it lasted 28 cycles. So
198 + (999999999 - 198) % 28 = 215. My answer was the 215th line of output.

For part 1 just run the tilt_board and the get_load functions.
